                    <p>
                        Our project was completed with relative ease, but we did run into two minor issues that slowed us down. 
                        The first problem is that our Servo Driver got damaged. 
                        We had to order a new one; this robbed us of time and money. 
                        The second problem is that the 3D-printer that belonged to one of our group members became damaged, 
                        so we had to print our parts with the 3D-printer belonging to our school. At the end of the day our project
                         went smoother than expected, even though we ran into a few minor obstacles.

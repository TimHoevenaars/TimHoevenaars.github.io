                         Looking back at our project there certainly is room for improvement. 
                        When we first started we were faced with the conundrum of assigning everyone a fitting task.
                         Because of COVID-19 and situations in the personal lives of group members, it was a 
                         challenge to give everyone a fitting role in the project. Some were unable to fulfill their tasks or 
                         they got outshined by other group members who had the same tasks. It would have been better if 
                         we had tackled this issue before we started our project, but eventually we were able to resolve the issue. 
                         Eventually everyone was assigned a task that worked best with their skills. We became a tightly knit group 
                         that was able to complement each other's strengths.

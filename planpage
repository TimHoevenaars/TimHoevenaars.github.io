                    <p>
                        Our plan started off as a grand idea, we were going to make an instrument that played itself. After a few brainstorms sessions we decided to 
                        make a guitar that played itself. We were planning to use a 3D-printer to make most of the plastic components ourselves. The instrument 
                        itself would be coded on a Microbit. When we were making our 3D-design we found out that a guitar would be far too complicated to finish in time. 
                        So we decided to use a ukulele instead. We made a new 3D-design and figured out how we were planning to bring our idea to life, afterwards we assigned 
                        tasks to each group member and we started working.

                      <p> My name is Tim, I’m sixteen years old and I am the webdesigner of our project. My job is to make sure that our website works and that all the included information checks out. I am planning on studying computer science, so a project like this is right up my alley. I have spent a lot of time making this website because I like to learn new things about web design. </p>

                      <p>My name is Jordy Lijs, I am currently seventeen years old and I am the so called ‘project manager’ of this assignment. The reason why I have this role is because it seemed fun; we proceeded to vote and I was chosen to be our project manager. I’m motivated to see this project through to the end and I’m happy to help whenever and wherever I might be needed.</p>

                      <p>My name is Corné, I am seventeen years old and my role in this project is to manage communications and to assist in developing our software. Because I have to work from home I mostly help with developing the software and not as much as writing the software. I took on the task of managing the email communication. All of the communication does get discussed beforehand, so eventually we all work together.</p>

                    <p>
                         At first we started brainstorming about what we wanted to make.
                         After a short while we decided on the idea of making a self playing guitar. 
                         Eventually we found out that it would be easier if we used a ukulele instead. 
                         So we changed our original plan, we also decided to put all the information about or project on a website. 
                         Afterwards we did some research on which parts we would need for our project so that we could bring our 
                         self playing ukulele to life. To do this we did a lot of online researching. After we had finished researching
                          our necessary supplies we asked around to find out what we had to buy ourselves and what our school already
                           had laying around. We had to order the servo motors, batteries and wires ourselves.  Luckily for our bank 
                           accounts, the school decided to cover these expenses for us. We decided to let our supplies be delivered to
                            the part of the group that was in charge of our hardware, so that they could get to work as fast as possible. 
                            During this time our software divisions started practicing and getting familiar with the Microbit environment. 
                            After two weeks of learning and mastering Microbit the software division got to work on writing the code for
                             our project. After some time the hardware and software were put together to test if our ukulele worked. 
                             It worked straight off the bat. Afterwards Laura and Tiemon started working on writing the text for our website. 
                             When they were finished Jordy worked on translating all the text to English, as was requested by our teacher. At the same time Tim was finishing up the website.
